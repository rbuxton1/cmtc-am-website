        If you would like, we have a short video demonstration viewable here (not yet made!). Otherwise, here are some short articles explaining AR.

          Augmented Reality (AR) is an interactive experience where the real world environment can be modified and added to with computer generated graphics. A lot of the process and thought that goes into this comes down between the disciplines of computer vision and 3D graphics, as the end product is the combination of what <i>can</i> be seen and what <i>should</i> be seen.

          In practice this can be seen using our app (links) <a href="/banner">here</a>. In addition to this there are many other real world examples of this, like the popular mobile game Pok√©mon Go which uses AR to show the users the real world with videogame characters added in. Other examples include auto manufacturers allowing customers to see what's under the hood without actually having to open the hood.
