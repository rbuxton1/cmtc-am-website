This chess set was inspired by many spacecraft made by Lockheed Martin which were shown in the touchscreen to the left of the printer. This created a more tactile and tangible experience. â€‹With testing focused on readability and likeability, these pieces have undergone a series of changes. Through these iterations, we finalized a functional chess set.
