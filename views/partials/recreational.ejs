This chessboard was selected as a way to bring the spacecraft from the touchscreens to a more tactile, tangible experience. â€‹Testing has been focused on readability (is the piece recognizable as the part it is?) and likeability. Feedback was mixed and has led to minor changes, and as this process continues there will likely be more.
