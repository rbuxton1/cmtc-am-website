      Tourbillion
    </div>
    The tourbillon is a marvel of mechanical construction, originally made for high-end watches as a way to counteract the effect of gravity on individual parts of the watcheâ€™s mechanism. This tourbillon made with additive manufacturing is not the same scale as its practical counterpart -- however the mechanisms within are just as entertaining to watch!

      V8 Engine
    </div>
    A V8 engine is recognizable by its distinct V shape in the cylinders and the fact that they all share a common crankshaft. This example made with additive manufacturing won't allow you to be cruising around town in your muscle car, however you will be able to admire the work and craftsmanship that went into designing and producing engines like this in a time before computer aided design!
