These shadow art pieces are designed with a spherical outer shell and inner extrusions that block casted light to create a scene within the shadows. With a design focused on visual appeal and printability, these orbs have undergone a series of iterations to become what they are today. Each orb is the size of a tennis ball and was made with intractability in mind.  During the design process, each orbâ€™s silhouette is first drawn out. Below are some of the silhouettes that were considered. <br>
