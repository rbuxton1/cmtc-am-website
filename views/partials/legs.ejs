  The leg structure design was inspired by spacecraft landers, which can be seen in the shape created by the two structures flanking the central printer and the printer itself. <br> <br>

  Each leg structure stands 5 feet tall and supports a pair of interactive touchscreens. The structures are designed to make use of additive manufacturing, including the usage of topology optimization to add visual interest and provide a learning opportunity to showcase what additive manufacturing can create, even on a large scale.

    Topology optimization is the process of minimizing the material required to satisfy a set of loading conditions. The result is a reduction of weight and material waste while also decreasing manufacturing time. Additive manufacturing enables the production of designs created using topology optimization. The patterns used for this structure were created using a variety of loading conditions beyond those strictly required for the structure, and evaluated by potential users for their visual appeal and perceived stability. Users preferred the patterns that are more symmetric in both vertical and horizontal directions, leading to the selection above of panels to be used in each leg structure.

    This is what the screens looked like during development of the legs. Notice that they are on temporary stands and that the version of the system running on them may be slightly different from that which you would see in person (or through the web versions available below).

    <!-- ACTUALLY PUT INFO HERE -->
    These are screenshots of the screen application running. These images showcase how we hope to use this Technology to convey how the modern day advances of additive manufacturing are being put into use. <br>

    The left screen focuses on spacecraft history, one potential application of additive manufacturing, while the right screen showcases applications of additive manufacturing that are advancing other industries: healthcare and medical devices, transportation, and housing. Throughout are principles and best practices for additive manufacturing.
