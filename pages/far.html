    If you've ever played with classic construction toys you'll feel right at home with these! Instead of simple shapes like cubes and spheres, the 3D printed nature of these parts allows for them to complex shapes and for them to have connection points which would be otherwise complicated to add.

    The astrolabicon is a 3D puzzle who's end goal should be getting all like colored marbles touching. This at first does not sound particularly complicated but as you work the puzzle you will find that each turn changes the dynamics of the track which the marbles move within.

The designs for the pedestals first began as a brainstorming session. This was when ideas for display objects were still very new so both the pedestals and the display object concepts evolved together. The goal was to integrate the display as much as possible with the objects themselves. Below are some pictures of that process.<br> <br>

  To help narrow down the options from the first sketch to the final, a survey was sent out. Using the data gathered from the conjoint survey, the five most-liked designs were determined. These top five designs were then included in a subsequent survey which sought to test a user's visual interest in each pedestal and willingness to approach it. This subsequent survey shows that the pedestal in the top left corner of the last image ranked highest in all categories. Below is a render of what that may look like. <br>
